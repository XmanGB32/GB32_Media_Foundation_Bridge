Ever wanted to play an MP4 or MP3 from GB23 in a GB32 window and MCI is giving you grief?   

Now you can !  Thanks to the power of AIs and C++ I got created a DLL that leverages Media Foundation !

Media Foundation is the default, supported, modern replacement for DirectShow and works everywhere your users actually run Windows today.
